## Dream App (name to come)

"We are not having the dream, the dream has us..." -Hélène Cixous
"Whoever wants to dream must mix all things together." -Albrecht Dürer

My project will be a speech driven dream journaling app where users can keep track of their dreams - an important method for dealing with nightmares/terrors and practicing sleep hygiene. I will include night mode for reducing eye strain, and I hope to one day be able to integrate sleep study and neuroimaging data.
