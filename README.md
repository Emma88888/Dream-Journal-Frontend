## Dream Journaling App

## Project Description 

My project will be a dream journaling app where users can keep track of their dreams - an important method for dealing with nightmares/terrors and practicing sleep hygiene. My project will include a speech to text feature in python, as well as night mode for reducing eye strain.

## Technologies Used

- MERN stack

## Models

`
const Dream = new Schema({
     date: Date,
     dream: String
})
`

For my speech to text input, I will have to figure out what the data type is although I'm assuming it will be a string.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want a simple, non-distracting interface that is focused on my sleep quality/hygiene.
- As a user, I want to be able to use speech-to-text if it's easier for me than writing my dreams down.
- As a user, I want to also have the option to write my dreams down.
- As a user, I want to be able to access, delete and edit past dreams I've recorded.
- As a user, I want access to resources that might help me with sleep quality.
